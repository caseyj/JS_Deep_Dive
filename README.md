##Introduction

This project was designed with the need of a complete deep copy system for a network of javascript objects. Typically when building a javascript set of objects a set of deep copy operations must be defined by hand by the programmer to create a complete deep copy of an object. These object relationships do not necessarily require a deep copy on every object reference, or a shallow copy, the system defined in this project will distinguish the difference between these copy requirements and produce the proper clone network. Both networks will be identical but entirely separate in memory.
